# MTLnet

Author: Preya Shah

Welcome! This project carries out core analyses and visualizations for exploring functional and structural network connectivity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). We have provide a sample dataset, and our methods can be applied to your own datasets of healthy or diseased subjects. Input data includes time series from 7T resting state BOLD-fMRI as well as volumetric data derived from 7T T2-weighted MRI.

To get started, open up the IPython notebook "MTLnet" under the "scripts folder.

This serves as a supplement to our paper in submission at Human Brain Mapping [link to be included upon publication of paper]. Please see paper for details on image acquisition, processing, and analysis.

MTL segmentation was carried out using the ASHS pipeline (https://sites.google.com/site/hipposubfields/)
