The provided data is organized into two folders: (1) structural, and (2) functional. 

(1) Structural:
  (a) all_volumes.csv: 
      - raw gray-matter volumes of each MTL subregion for all subjects
      - organized as an N X P matrix of values, where N is the number of subregions and P is the number of subjects  
  
  (b) all_extents.csv
      - anterior-posterior extent (in number of slices) of each MTL subregion for all subjects
      - organized as an N X P matrix of values, where N is the number of subregions and P is the number of subjects
      - used to normalize the extra-hippocampal regions by A-P extent, as described in our paper and in Yushkevich et al 2015, HBM
  
  (c) all_ICV.csv
      - intracranial volumes for each subject
      - organized as 1 X P vector, where P is the number of subjects
      - used to normalize volumes by ICV, as explained in the paper


(2) Functional:
      - Each subject's data is in a separate folder
      - For each subject there are two files: res_tcourse_L.txt and res_tcourse_R.txt. 
      - Each is organized as an n x T matrix, where n is the number of subregions per hemisphere, and T is the number of time points
      - Note that the subregions include two subregions per hemisphere that we don't care about (HEAD and MISC), so those rows are discarded upon analysis
     
Note: raw data, which includes T2 images, ASHS segmentations, and resting BOLD-fMRI is provided  at the 
following dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1ocw0p638qc8zt7/AABt0XbkO4xYWj8HJxo9fN-ta?dl=0 . 
For now, a subset of subjects is included due to space limitations.
